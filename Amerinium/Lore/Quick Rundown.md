Amerinium is a space-based cyberpunk role-playing game set in the year 2300. 

##### Main Event Leading to Current World

A war finally breaks out across Planet Earth, forcing humanity to the brink of societal collapse. As Russia seizes control of America through brute force with China's help, the war comes to a screeching and fearful halt. As America falls, Russia and China quickly take control of the rest of the world's political and economical operations. 

Attempts were made throughout the timeline from thereon to reinstate America's sovereignty, but they failed. Instead, the land that was once America became the hot bed for a civil war. The bones of a nation, left to defend its coffin against two ravenous grave diggers. 

The war was fought brutally, but the overwhelming force of two healthy supernations was impossible to overcome. Even with Britain's help, the subversion and deterioration of the U.S Government leading up to the war had taken its toll. There would be no one left to direct the people in any sensical fashion. 

The current world of Amerinium takes place not too far beyond this point. As humanity grows from this emotional scar, and adjusts to the painful political landscape, their eyes once again become set on space. <- in progress
